					<p>Malad’s most busy area which houses Jughead’s, Andy's Bar and Kitchen and Northern Tadka is now home to a trendy Mexican restaurant.</p>

					Think Mexico and you’ll imagine bright sunshine, long winding roads through the desert, huge Saguaro cactus along the way and some iguanas to scare you off.  Think Mexican food and you think of a food fare that includes a huge platter of nachos with guacamole, chunky burritos and crisp tacos with hot sauces. Zapata’s, a new restaurant on link road in Malad, doesn’t quite strike the Mexican cord with its regular café-like decor. The only Mexican feature we spotted was the <strong>Sombrero</strong> (Mexican hats) on top a few tequila bottles.<br><br>

					The restaurant has a small alfresco area where you can catch all the world cup action live. The bar stretches along one wall and an Aviator-wearing, cigar-smoking Chihuahua looks down at you from the other. We’re told that the painting of the dog is the work of Nilesh Vede, the artist who taught Salman Khan to paint.<br><br>
					The huge framed menu includes quick bites, salads, side dishes, platters and <strong>Vegan Enchiladas</strong> (Rs320) - baked corn tortillas stuffed with vegetables and served with a tomato based sauce, to keep the community happy.<br><br>

					<strong>Nachos De Zapatas</strong> (Rs 550) – nachos topped with sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, black olives and jalapenos are served on a bed of baked beans with chicken. The platter is a good option if you’re out for drinks in a big group. While the dish was quite a medley of flavours, we wish the nachos were crisper.<br><br>
					We were wiping the sweat off our brows after eating <strong>Z’Habanero Chicken</strong> (Rs 380) - soft boneless pieces of chicken drenched in spicy habanero sauce served with a side of fries. The Mexican habanero chilli stands fifth on the Scoville Scale and is definitely not for the faint hearted. You’ll surely need something to wash down this one so order the house special <strong>Zapata Nuevos</strong>  (Rs 450) - Tequila, water melon juice, lime juice. Every sip of this pale pink drink felt like a strong Tequila shot.<br><br>

					The chef recommendations included <strong>Asado Braised Lamb Taquitos</strong> (Rs 340) and <strong>Chipotle Grilled Fish Burrito</strong> (Rs 340). Papdi sized taquitos were topped with slow cooked shredded lamb. The juicy lamb was garnished with finely chopped onions and was made zestier with a spritz of lime. The burrito had beautifully grilled fish with Mexican tomato rice, refried beans and sour cream wrapped in thin tortilla. The sour cream perfectly coated the flaky fish giving it a tangy flavour.<br><br>
					The meal ended with <strong>Tres Leches</strong> (Rs 200) and <strong>Churros</strong> (Rs 180). Our spoon slid through the spongy cake soaked in evaporated milk, condensed milk and heavy cream. The warm brown churros served with chocolate sauce may not be the best we’ve tried but good enough to disappear in a bite or two. Zapata’s serves big portions and has enough going for it to keep the locals happy. The well stocked bar and pocket friendly prices will make sure that it’s crowded on weekends.<br><br>
					<strong>Must Try :</strong> Asado Braised Lamb Taquitos, Chipotle Grilled Fish Burrito, Z’Habanero Chicken.<br>
					<strong>Meal For Two :</strong> Rs 1,500 + taxes (with alcohol)
